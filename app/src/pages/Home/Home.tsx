      <h1>VW Digital Hub</h1>

      <p>
        This is a project created from scratch using <strong>Vite</strong>, to
        which I manually added the dependencies as needed. The purpose was to
        build a solid and well-structured foundation that could eventually be
        split into a monorepo.
      </p>

      <h2>üì¶ Dependencies Used</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>react-query</strong>
          <br />
          Used as the client state manager. Everything related to server
          communication is located in the <code>src/api</code> folder, organized
          into mutations and queries ready to be imported and used with React
          Query. There's also a folder called <code>primitives</code> that
          contains primitive methods for server calls and utility functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>styled-components</strong>
          <br />
          Used for styling organization. I chose this library because I‚Äôm
          experienced with it and it allowed for faster development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>react-router v7</strong>
          <br />
          Used in its <strong>Data API mode</strong> for routing and navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>react-icons</strong>
          <br />A library of ready-to-use, easily importable icons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>use-debounce</strong>
          <br />A hook used to debounce the search input‚Äôs callback. I used it
          to save time instead of creating a custom hook from scratch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>react-intersection-observer</strong>
          <br />A small library that helped implement infinite scroll for the
          paginated notes display.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>üõ† Development Tools</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Vitest</strong>: Testing framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>React Testing Library</strong>: For writing tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ESLint</strong>: Linting tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>json-server</strong>: Used to mock the backend. Notes are
          persisted in a <code>db.json</code> file at the root of the project.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>üìÅ Folder Structure</h2>

      <h3>
        <code>ds</code> (Design System)
      </h3>
      <p>
        This folder acts as a mini design system for the app. It contains styled
        components, as well as color and typography tokens under the{" "}
        <code>config</code> folder. The configuration includes a global CSS
        reset.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, I intended to move this folder into a separate package within
        a <strong>monorepo</strong> and publish it as an{" "}
        <strong>npm library</strong>. Although I didn't have time to do so, the
        folder has no dependencies on other parts of the app, making this change
        straightforward if needed.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <code>api</code>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Contains everything related to communication with the backend API. Like
        the design system, it‚Äôs also structured to be easily moved to its own
        monorepo package if necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <code>components</code>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Includes the reusable components developed throughout the project. The
        key structural components are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>Layout</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Content</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Header</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>SideBar</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It also includes two global service components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>Modal</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Toast</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These components follow a self-contained architecture, each with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The main component file</li>
        <li>A context for managing internal state</li>
        <li>
          A set of custom hooks that expose a clear interface to the rest of the
          app
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If I had more time, I would move these into their own library within the
        monorepo.
      </p>

      <h2>‚úÖ Testing & CI</h2>
      <p>
        Due to time limitations, I was only able to write unit tests for the
        most basic components in the design system folder. The environment was
        configured using <strong>Vitest</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>React Testing Library</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I aimed to showcase my own development skills, I did make
        limited use of <strong>AI</strong> (ChatGPT) to help generate some unit
        tests and to solve specific project configuration issues. All other code
        was written manually.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <strong>CI/CD</strong>, I set up basic workflows using{" "}
        <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pull Requests</strong>: Run linting and tests
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pushes</strong>: Run linting, tests, build the app, and deploy
          to <strong>Vercel</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        üöÄ <strong>Live app</strong>:{" "}
        <a href="https://vw-digital-hub.vercel.app/" target="_blank">
          https://vw-digital-hub.vercel.app/

  );
};
